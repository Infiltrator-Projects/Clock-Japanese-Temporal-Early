# Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock: forensic audit, 27 October 2026

The provider was built and exercised independently on Linux x86-64 with GCC 13, GLib 2.80 and ICU 74.2 where applicable. Compilation, ABI integrity, model conformance and historical authority are separate findings.

`make check` runs 84 baseline regression cases plus 80 independently sourced model fixtures. Calendar providers also check the failure-output contract. The broader audit used the counts and limits in [FORENSIC-AUDIT.json](../FORENSIC-AUDIT.json).

## Corrections

- NOAA fractional-year phase now uses 366 days in leap years.
- Pre-Kansei dawn/dusk is 36 minutes before sunrise/after sunset, matching the NAOJ description.

## Accuracy boundaries and unresolved findings

- Numerical model/reconstruction, not an exact historical observing practice or precision ephemeris. See the measured astronomy errors in the full audit.
- Solar events assume a spherical sea-level horizon and standard depression; terrain, weather, and genuine polar no-crossing conditions are outside the reconstruction.
- Finite sampled checks establish only the stated model/ranges. They do not certify every historical region, all translations, every host ICU/CLDR release, or another operating system/architecture.

## Provenance and reproducibility

The original Common 1.19.78 source remains unchanged. Source-manifest hashes describe the initial extraction; subsequent corrections are recorded by Git and this audit. Original copy-comparison results are historical evidence of the extraction, not a claim that corrected code remains behavior-identical to Common.

6 baseline observations changed following documented corrections. Independent model/contract fixtures cover those bug classes.
