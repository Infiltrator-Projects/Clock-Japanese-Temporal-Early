# Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock — computational and historical model

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Stable provider ID | `japanese-temporal-early` |
| Resource kind | `clock` |
| Canonical compiled name | `Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock.so` |
| Intended installation | `/System/Resources/Clocks/Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock.so` |

## Maintained model

Early Edo seasonal toki/bell hours with 0.833° sunrise/sunset boundaries.

## Historical scope / fidelity limitation

**Implemented interpretation:** Early Edo Japanese seasonal clock.

**Fidelity boundary:** Different boundary from late Edo model; reconstruction from modern astronomy.

This is an account of the implemented model, not a claim that a particular mathematical projection was observed or officially used in every historical period. Where the source model uses approximations, retrospective continuation or external ICU/CLDR authorities, that distinction must remain explicit.

## Observable behaviour

The clock owns both its notation and next-visible-tick scheduling. Its output needs valid geographic coordinates; missing/invalid coordinates are unavailable, not an implicit Greenwich location. Undefined solar crossings at extreme latitudes must be reported as unavailable rather than invented.

## Unsupported inputs and reproducibility

Missing providers are unavailable; consumers must not substitute a different provider with a similar name. Malformed or out-of-range inputs must return an explicit failure without modifying outputs. Module metadata must convey its true ID and kind, independent of filename ordering.

## Provenance

The model and boundary above are documented from the current resource build map, Calendar model matrix and Common historical-fidelity audit. They have not yet been independently requalified in this repository.

## Source copy status

The model-specific implementation and required helpers are now copied into this repository. Its behaviour was compared with the original Common 1.19.78 provider; this adds copy-regression evidence, not a new independent historical audit. See [source provenance](../SOURCE.md) and [validation results](../VALIDATION-RESULTS.json). The original Common implementation remains in place.
