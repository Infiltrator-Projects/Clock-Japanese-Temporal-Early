# Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock

**InfiltratorOS clock resource** · **Stable ID:** `japanese-temporal-early` · **Module:** `Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock.so`

Pre-Kansei Edo seasonal toki/bell hours: dawn 36 minutes before sunrise and dusk 36 minutes after sunset, using a 0.833° sunrise/sunset model.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Different boundary from late Edo model; reconstruction from modern astronomy.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Clocks/Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock.so` (case-sensitive)

The clock owns both its notation and next-visible-tick scheduling. Its output needs valid geographic coordinates; missing/invalid coordinates are unavailable, not an implicit Greenwich location. Undefined solar crossings at extreme latitudes must be reported as unavailable rather than invented.

## Status

**Independent source, native installation and releases.** This repository contains the implementation of `japanese-temporal-early`, the supporting code it needs, a one-provider `Makefile` and focused regression fixtures. The copy is based on Common 1.19.78 at `8d60662114e3`; the original Common source remains unchanged.

Run `make` to produce `build/Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock.so` and `make check` to run this provider's checks. No Common checkout or Common archive is required. Independent releases now provide a portable amd64 Debian package, a hardware-native source installer and the complete source ZIP. The original Common source is retained.

See [source provenance and build details](SOURCE.md), [source manifest](SOURCE-MANIFEST.json) and [recorded validation](VALIDATION-RESULTS.json).

## Independent forensic audit

See [audit findings](docs/FORENSIC-AUDIT.md) for corrections, numerical-model limits and unresolved authority disagreements. A successful build is not a historical-accuracy certificate.

## Release and installation

Run `make release` to qualify and create exactly three assets in `dist/`: a portable amd64 `.deb`, a `-native-installer.run`, and a complete `-source.zip`. Linux releases are built and installed by GitHub Actions before publication.

Run the downloaded `.run --profile aggressive` as an ordinary user. It provisions missing build prerequisites, compiles for the local CPU with `-O3`, LTO and measured two-pass PGO, checks the final module, then installs a native Debian package through sudo. InfiltratorOS invokes `--profile aggressive --system-package-mode` from its serialized installation worker. `--build-only --output DIRECTORY` qualifies a native package without installing it.

Each package owns only this provider and its passive documentation. Its `Replaces` declaration transfers this module from `infiltrator-calendar-resources` on existing machines; other modules and Common source remain intact. Native package versions use `+native1` so a same-version generic package does not replace a local optimized build. See [packaging details](docs/PACKAGING.md).
