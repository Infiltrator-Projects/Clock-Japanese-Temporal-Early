# Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock

**InfiltratorOS clock resource** · **Stable ID:** `japanese-temporal-early` · **Module:** `Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock.so`

Early Edo seasonal toki/bell hours with 0.833° sunrise/sunset boundaries.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Different boundary from late Edo model; reconstruction from modern astronomy.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Clocks/Early Edo Japanese Temporal Clock.so` (case-sensitive)

The clock owns both its notation and next-visible-tick scheduling. Its output needs valid geographic coordinates; missing/invalid coordinates are unavailable, not an implicit Greenwich location. Undefined solar crossings at extreme latitudes must be reported as unavailable rather than invented.

## Status

**Documentation-only:** The runnable provider, tests, current combined resource packaging and release process are still in Libraries/Common. This new repository has not yet been populated with executable source, standalone tests, an installer, or a verified release.

This repository is intended to become an independently buildable, testable and installable provider, not a duplicate application-specific implementation. Calendar, Files, System Settings and compatible consumers discover executable providers through Common.
